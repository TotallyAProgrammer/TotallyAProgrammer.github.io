    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>I'm Zane Reick, a (mostly) self taught programmed with various skills in engineering and design, along with small doses of artisitic skills.</p>
    <p>I'm also currently a student at Omaha North High School where I study all 4 letters of their STEM program.</p>
    <p>I am not really sure what else to put on this page, so I am going to link to some examples of things I have created in my programming career.</p>
